# Design Patterns

## What are design patterns?

Design patterns are solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They are not complete designs of a system, but rather a template for how to solve a problem. They are often used to communicate design ideas between developers. They are also a great way to ensure that your code is maintainable and extensible.

# Types of design patterns

There are three main types of design patterns:

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

## Creational

Creational design patterns are concerned with the creation of objects. They are used to create objects in a way that is suitable for a given situation without revealing the creation method. The normal approach for creating an object might lead to complexities in the design of a project. These patterns allow flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a specific use case by providing control over the creation process.

### When to use the creational pattern

- When you want to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client
- When you want to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created

## Structural

Structural design patterns are concerned with the structure of objects. They are used to form larger structures from simple objects. They are used to simplify the design of a system by identifying the relationships between objects and classes. They are also used to identify the relationships between objects and classes.

### When to use the structural pattern

- When you want to represent a complex structure as a single object

## Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the communication between objects and classes. They are used to simplify the design of a system by identifying the relationships between objects and classes. They are also used to identify the relationships between objects and classes.

### When to use the behavioral pattern

- When you want to represent a complex structure as a single object
